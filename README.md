# CANUCS JWST Data Tutorials

This repository hosts Jupyter Notebook tutorials designed to help astronomers work with data from the CANUCS DR1 (CAnadian NIRISS Unbiased Cluster Survey).

## Getting started

The best place to get started is with the tutorial here: **[Exploring a Single CANUCS Galaxy](./exploring_single_galaxy_tutorial.ipynb)**: Learn how to load, visualize, and access data for an individual galaxy from the CANUCS survey. This includes plotting photometric redshift PDFs, image cutouts, SED fits, and accessing underlying data arrays. You can also run this notebook on the cloud using Google Colab - open the page and click the [open in colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kartheikiyer/CANUCS-DR-Notebooks/blob/jules_wip_4550658658641134423/exploring_single_galaxy_tutorial.ipynb) link to get started.
